### Summary
99.98% of reviewers who 5 star reviews were non-vine users. Whereas 0.017% of 5 star reviews were by vine members. This does not describes a positivity review bias towards the vine-program. It is quite evident there is not a positivity review bias due to the weighted percents. But if more analysis is needed you could analyze the statistical distribution.
